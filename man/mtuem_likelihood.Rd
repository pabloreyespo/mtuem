\title{Likelihood function for the parameter estimation of a Microeconomic Time-Use-Expenditure Model.}
\usage{
mtuem_likelihood(mtuem_settings, functionality = "estimate")
}
\arguments{
\item{mtuem_settings}{List of arguments to the functions. It must contain the following. User input is required for all settings except those with a default or marked as optional.
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{work_times}} Character. Name of the work time column
\item \strong{\code{free_times}} Character vector. Optional. Names of the freely allocated times. (Remember to left one out for identification)
\item \strong{\code{free_goods}} Character vector. Optional. Names of the freely consumed goods.(Remember to left one out for identification)
\item \strong{\code{goods_cost}} Named list. Optional. Cost associated to the consumption of each good. If not especified assumed as 1. Then Expeneses equal consumption of the good.
\item \strong{\code{work_elasticities}} Named list. Value of the elasticity parameters associated to work equation. Mandatory names are Theta, Phi and thw (theta work).
\item \strong{\code{times_elasticities}} List. Optional. Value of the elasticity parameters associated to freely allocated times. Must be in the same order of \code{free_times}.
\item \strong{\code{goods_elasticities}} List. Optional. Value of the elasticity parameters associated to freely allocated goods Must be in the same order of \code{free_goods}.
\item \strong{\code{sig}} List. Optional. Value of the sigma parameters (standard deviations) of the error covariance matrix. One element for equation. If not specified inferred by the observed errors.
\item \strong{\code{rho}} List. Optional. Value of the correlation parameters of the upper diagonal of the error covariance matrix. Must be ordered horizontally. Only used if \code{sigma} is specified. If rho is not correlations are assumed to be zero.
\item \strong{\code{Tc}} Numeric vector. Budget for each observation.
\item \strong{\code{Ec}} Numeric vector. Committed expenses for each observation.
\item \strong{\code{w}} Numeric vector. Wage rate for each observation.
\item \strong{\code{tau}} Numeric vector or scalar. Time Budget.
\item \strong{\code{componentName}}: Character. Name given to model component. If not provided by the user, Apollo will set the name automatically according to the element in \code{P} to which the function output is directed.
}}

\item{functionality}{Character. Setting instructing Apollo what processing to apply to the likelihood function. This is in general controlled by the functions that call \code{apollo_probabilities}, though the user can also call \code{apollo_probabilities} manually with a given functionality for testing/debugging. Possible values are:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{"estimate"}}: For model estimation, produces likelihood of the full model, at the level of individual decision-makers, after averaging across draws.
\item \strong{\code{"conditionals"}}: For conditionals, produces likelihood of the full model, at the level of individual inter-individual draws.
\item \strong{\code{"output"}}: Prepares output for post-estimation reporting.
\item \strong{\code{"prediction"}}: For model prediction, produces probabilities for individual alternatives and individual model components (if multiple components are present) at the level of an observation, after averaging across draws.
\item \strong{\code{"preprocess"}}: Prepares likelihood functions for use in estimation.
\item \strong{\code{"raw"}}: For debugging, produces probabilities of all alternatives and individual model components at the level of an observation, at the level of individual draws.
\item \strong{\code{"report"}}: Prepares output summarising model and choiceset structure.
\item \strong{\code{"validate"}}: Validates model specification, produces likelihood of the full model, at the level of individual decision-makers, after averaging across draws.

\value{
array of likelihood for each individual

\description{
The implementation is based on Jara-Diaz et.al. (2008) consisting of the maximization of a Cobb-Douglass utility function dependent on Time-use (T) and Goods Consumption (X).
The model is subject to time budget, monetary budget and technical time-use-expenditure constraints (committed time and expenditures).
